 How to hack this axample:
 
 this is streamlined proposition for screen (map of pixels with x,y position -adress)
 and what is happen to any pixel in time of video streaming
 function constant is main function for data (changes) adressing
it is not working code in any language ,just so basic proposition/draft


for one frame (still image)


define pixel (p)
define vertical (y)
define horizontal (x)
{
p = y, x
define p(x) = y, x+1
define p(y) = y+1, p(x)
	{
	if p(x) = constant (x) , constant(y)
 then 
	print 
	p = constant(x), constant(y)
	 else 
	fill p = x,y
	else
    p(x)+1 = constant (x) , constant (y)+1 
         then 
	print 
	p = constant(x), constant (y)+1 
	else 
	fill p = x,y
	fi

}
}
