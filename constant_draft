 and for example fullhd video in time with every pixel in resolution
 
 define pixel (p)   //pixel is for examle 12bit string for some complex panels
 define time (z)    // time is grabed/probed from wideo if recoreding exist or if it is realtime transmission 
 define vertical (y) // y is vertical postion //1-1080
 define horizontal (x) // x is horizontal position //1-1920
 define constant = (n+1 == n) // every next bit representation of probed pixel is the same as first i n pool to next pool (where is different)
 define framepool = 2073600 (1080x1920pixels) ( frame pool is multiplication  x horizontal pixels and y vertical pixels
 define unique_pixel_pool = $[1-$(framepool){p_ad}]     //(1-2073600{p_ad}) // adrreses for that pool loaded in to memory /2073600x12bit=24883200 /25mbit/3,5magebyte
 define pool = $unique_pixel_poll //pool of adresses for  ingrid-processing 
 {
 grab pool = for each y(1), x(1), z(1) do
 
 compress pool = (pa_ad)    ///first and every next  unchenged stream steams (still image + data in time z times)
 ( 
 if p_ad(1) = constant (y) , constant (x) , constant (z)
 then 
 print 
 p_ad = constant(x), constant (y), constant(z)
 else 
 grab p_ad + 1 = (x =  last + 1 , y = last + 1, z = last + 1 )
 then
 if p_ad + 1 = constant (y) , constant (x) , constant (z) 
 then 
 print  
 p_ad + 1 = constant(x), constant (y), constant(z)
)
 fi
 )
 done
 
 
 
 
 haha 
 How to hack this axample:
 
 this is streamlined proposition for screen (map of pixels with x,y position -pixel adres)
 and what is happen to any pixel in time when video streaming
 function constant (c.onstant[t.imes]n.ew) where n.ew is pool of the same bits (every next bit is the 
 same in pool /[n+1=n] / as first before next different t times) is main function for data (changes) adressing
it is not working code in any language ,just so basic proposition/draft

(c.onstant[t.imes]n.ew)
(s.tatic["1"]n.ew)

may be answered it is most simple end most lees loosing data example where camera somthing records (also based on this constant proposal ) is decompresed in not frames per second
but for example camera possibilities (120frames/sec) is matching screen with 120frames/sec rate but if screen is only 60 fr/sec data needed from 
stream for that screen is step1 (needed) after step2 not needed is probed, also if scren is 4 times square smaller data is also in two steps
ommiited for x in rows and y in rows





for one frame (still image)

define pixel (p)
define vertical (y)
define horizontal (x)
{
p = y, x
define p(x) = y, x+1
define p(y) = y+1, p(x)
	{
	if p(x) = constant (x) , constant(y)
 then 
	print 
	p = constant(x), constant(y)
	 else 
	fill p = x,y
	else
    p(x)+1 = constant (x) , constant (y)+1 
         then 
	print 
	p = constant(x), constant (y)+1 
	else 
	fill p = x,y
	fi

}
}
