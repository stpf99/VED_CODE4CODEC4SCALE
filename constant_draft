 define pixel (p)
 define time (z)
 define vertical (y)
 define horizontal (x)
 
 {
 grab p = y(1), x(1), z(1)
 compress p = 1
 ( 
 if p(1) = constant (y) , constant (x) , constant (z)
 then 
 print 
 p = constant(x), constant (y), constant(z)
 else 
 grab p +1 = (x =  last + 1 , y = last + 1, z = last + 1 )
 then
 if p + 1 = constant (y) , constant (x) , constant (z) 
 then 
 print  
 p + 1 = constant(x), constant (y), constant(z)

 How to hack this axample:
 
 this is streamlined proposition for screen (map of pixels with x,y position -adress)
 and what is happen to any pixel in time of video streaming
 function constant is main function for data (changes) adressing
it is not working code in any language ,just so basic proposition/draft
